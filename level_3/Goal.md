🔥 Let’s level you up — ensembling is where **top Kaggle competitors win**. It's not just about having one great model — it's about **combining multiple perspectives** for smarter predictions.

## 🎯 Goal: Ensemble Multiple Models to Boost Titanic Accuracy

We'll use this 3-model strategy to start:

### ✅ Models to Include:
1. **XGBoost** → Already tuned, performs great
2. **Random Forest** → More stable, lower variance
3. **Logistic Regression** → Simple linear model to add contrast

Then we’ll **blend** their predictions using:
- **Soft voting (average predicted probabilities)** → More stable than hard voting
- Optionally: **weighted voting** if one model performs much better

### 🔧 Ready for Implementation?

I’ll set you up with:
- A clean ensemble pipeline
- Preprocessing shared across all models
- `predict_proba()`-based blending
- Final `submission.csv` output

🎯 Perfect — you're thinking like a serious ML practitioner, not just a competitor. We'll go step-by-step and tune each model on its own before ensembling. This is **the most powerful and educational route** — you'll truly understand what each model brings to the table.

## 🧠 Ensemble Strategy (Foundational Version)

We'll build and tune:

| Model               | Purpose                                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ✅ XGBoost          | Non-linear, gradient boosting, fine-tuned  |
| ✅ Random Forest    | Bagging method, low variance                |
| ✅ Logistic Regression | Simple, linear model to capture linearly separable patterns |

Each will have:
- Independent preprocessing
- Hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV`
- Cross-validation evaluation
- Prediction generation via `predict_proba()`

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Plan

### 📦 Phase 1: Build & Tune Models
1. Use shared feature-engineered dataset ✅
2. Create pipelines per model:
   - Preprocessor (SimpleImputer + OneHotEncoder)
   - Model (`XGBClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `LogisticRegression`)
3. Tune with `GridSearchCV`

### 🔁 Phase 2: Predict + Ensemble
1. Predict using `.predict_proba()` from each model
2. Average the probabilities (soft voting)
3. Threshold at 0.5 to classify survival

### 📤 Phase 3: Final Submission
1. Generate `submission.csv`
2. Upload to Kaggle and compare!
