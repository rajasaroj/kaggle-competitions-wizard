Great job getting it fixed and submitted! 🙌

Let’s unpack what happened and how to move forward.

## 🤔 So Why is Kaggle Score Lower?

This is actually a **common scenario** in real competitions. Here's what's likely going on:

### 1. **Overfitting to Training Set**
Your model (especially RF at 98% train score) might have:
- Memorized noise or passenger-specific artifacts
- Performed great on CV folds
- But struggled with **unseen real test data** (Kaggle private test)

### 2. **Baseline Was Simpler But More General**
The gender submission uses simple rules:
- Female = Survive
- Male + Pclass3 = Die  
It's not optimal, but it's **stable and generalizes well**.
