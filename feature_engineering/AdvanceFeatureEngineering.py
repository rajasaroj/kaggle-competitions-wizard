# STEP: 2
# ðŸª™ Feature Engineering Booster #2: FarePerPerson
# On Titanic, many passengers shared tickets (especially in 3rd class). The Fare column shows the total fare paid, not per person.
# So someone who paid 100 for 4 people really paid 25 per person â€” a more accurate signal of wealth/class, the wealthy one has higher survival rate

# STEP: 3
# ðŸ“› Feature Engineering Booster #3: SurnameGroupSurvivalRate (or FamilySurvivalScore)
# âœ… Why This Feature?
# On Titanic, people often traveled with family (same last name). In many cases:
# If some family members survived, others did too
# If a surname group had all deaths, it could signal poor survival odds for others in that group
# This is a way to leverage label correlations inside the train set, without peeking at test labels.

# âœ… Step-by-Step Integration
# ðŸ”¹ 1. Extract Surname from Name
FULL_DF['Surname'] = FULL_DF['Name'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[0].strip())

# ðŸ”¹ 2. Compute SurnameSurvivalRate from train data only, Compute average survival rate per surname (only from train set)
surname_survival = FULL_DF[FULL_DF['set'] == 'train'].groupby('Surname')['Survived'].mean()

# ðŸ”¹ 3. Map it to full dataset (train + test), Map to all passengers (some test surnames won't be in train)
FULL_DF['SurnameSurvivalRate'] = FULL_DF['Surname'].map(surname_survival)

# ðŸ”¹ 4. Handle Missing Values
global_survival_rate = FULL_DF[FULL_DF['set'] == 'train']['Survived'].mean()
